	<p>Initially I struggled with this interaction because of how simple or how difficult I could interpret it. I sketched down initial ideas of creating a day and night kind of concept where I would have a button or scroll to change the time in day. This concept tumbled into other ideas that have to deal with growth or for example: how long it takes for a candle to melt. Most of my initial ideas were straightforward with the concept of making a lot of games or interactions to use up your time. I started researching elements I wanted to incorporate into my website like: having a timer that automatically times how long you are on the browser, dark mode (for night time), and a countdown timer for a day of your choice.</p>
