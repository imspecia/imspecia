          <p>How to Crit by Mitch Goldstein </p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="http://howtocrit.com/"> http://howtocrit.com/</a></p>
          <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
          <p>What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? 
          <br>
             How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?
          <br>
             Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques? 
          </p>
          <p>When I first started university I was terrified of critiques and honestly really dreaded them when it came to it. I find it challenging when I receive and give critiques because initially I wasn't okay with all the different options or opinions that came my way and how it would change my idea so I sometimes have that in mind when it comes to my peers. Sometimes it is hard to give a critique when you don't have much to work with, it might just be initial sketches or a confusing layout. For example I had a class where a lot of people showed initial sketches or concepts during the second last to last critique. It is hard to give feedback to others when you can't see their idea or vision. Even if you want to help them, there might not be enough progress to discuss further possible developments. Me being a visual learner, can find giving critiques a challenge as I find that I need to see some type of visual to help someone. (ie. sketches, colours, layout + concept altogether)</p>
          <p>Usually when I disagree with a critique, it takes me a while to get those words into my head to starting working to improve or add onto my concept. I also find it challenging to figure out which part of the critique I should listen to and which ones that don't flow with my concept or look and feel I am going for. Sometimes I need a minute to take a breather and not let that particular feedback give a negative feeling or I might need to let my emotions out before I can think about it again. At times I will ask the person to elaborate or try to discuss a way to adapt the feedback into my work while incorporating any new ideas I have when receiving the feedback. Other times I might scratch out that feedback or idea entirely if it is something I really disagree with. </p>
          <p>I like to think of the word "critique" as just feedback from peers / professor so it doesn't seem as intense. I find that giving and receiving this feedback is really helpful when you are having an artist block while working on your concept. It is really important to get other opinions on your work because if it was just all you, you might miss some small details or maybe even bigger opportunities that your could have used. Like the articles says "you should walk away from getting a crit feeling empowered and excited to make the work better, not defeated and miserable from the experience." I think listening to other critiques can also be beneficial to you, although you might not share the same concept, it can still help with your process. We don't need to fear or have a negative feeling towards feedback because it helps us grow and improve our work. Think of each opinion as a possible opportunity that you can take, modify or decline.</p>

          <h3>Reading 2: What Screens Want</h3>

          <p>What Screens Want by Frank Chimero</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/"> https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/</a></p>
          <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
          <p>Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.
          <br>
             What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
          <br>
             Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.
          </p>
          <p> Designing for web interfaces is not just purely aesthetics, they serve other functions such as acting as a guide for users who may not be well versed in design languages. I think there is no one ideological cap that is better than the other. The answer also should not lie somewhere in the middle either. I imagine that each camp has its own place in interface design and favoring one over the other would be like favoring one ice cream flavor over another. Both have their place and depending on the user, the developer, or both they can both be used to an effective degree. Screens are malleable in their use meaning that they are whatever we need them to be. More complex screens can serve as output as well as inputs where the use of skeuomorphic design would be preferred over flat design. Some screens can be simple, take an alarm clock for instance. Their requirement is not complex and a simple flat design would be sufficient. I strongly believe design principles and ideological camps depend massively on the context of the work and therefore believe there is a place for both flat and skeuomorphic design. </p>
          <p>A zoopraxiscope is a device used to animate a sequence of still photographs and is the predecessor of later motion picture devices. It is made by printing high speed sequential photos on a glass disc and spinning it with a light source from behind. The result is a short sequence of an animation. Another example from filmmaking is their use of sensory data to evoke a certain feeling or emotion. For instance, by using colors, shapes, animations, and typography, they can elicit a particular feeling in their audience. Digital design also uses similar tactics to achieve these similar feelings in their users. This technique is being employed to great degree for things like animal shelter sites where they try to create a feeling of sadness and pity through their use of images, colors and sometimes even sounds. Due to the effectiveness that sensory information has on viewers, we see this technique being used everywhere. Just recently, with the election going on, many advertisements employ the tactic of showing footage of their competitors in black and white with bold and upsetting fonts to sway the viewer’s emotions a certain way. It is proven that this is effective and does work, it is only a matter of time before this because a score component in digital design.</p>
          <p>Flux in the context of digital design is described as the capacity for change. Change in this case means that elements on the screen animates or moves and responds to users. The animations or movements could help aid in the user’s understanding of a particular function. The example they gave is the mac os’s minimizing effect where the window shrinks into their respective icon. This is an example of screen flux, where the screen wants to change. Another example would be your phone showing an unlock animation where you input your password. All these are screen changes which convey to the user that a specific function has happened. I agree that screens want flux, but not in the way that it is necessary. I think that with modern screen sizes and technology, it is designed to have movement, for viewing designs that incorporate high levels of flux. For example, the IPad Pro screens have functions HDR and ProMotion which enhances that change. This makes the viewing of these animations or flux more enjoyable for the users. So yes, in my opinion screens do want flux, they do want change and users do benefit from those changes.</p>

          <h3>Reading 3: Touring Complete User</h3>
          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>Touring Complete User by Olia Lialina</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/"> http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/</a></p>
          <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
          <p>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?  
          <br>
             What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
          <br>
             From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"? 
          </p>
          <p>The term user describes in the context of the article, the person operating the computer. However, as the computer becomes more and more invisible so should the user. This is what Norman wants, for users to just be called people. Instead of designing for users, we should be designing for people as computers have integrated so much within our society that everyone uses them. No longer are people separated into users and non-users, everyone uses computers so we should all just call them people. This is not what the author of this article Lialina says as she thinks it is “dangerous” (Lialina Invisible and Very Busy) as once we stop using the term user to describe people who use computers, there will be no more reminders that there is a computer or a system. What she is essentially saying is that without labeling the person using the computer, we will start to forget that there even is a computer being used. For example, we do not describe someone using the microwave/dishwasher/laundry machine as a user or anything for that matter. If you think about it, those appliances are so integrated into our daily lives we do not think much of them. It just exists and is just there to do what it needs to do. As technology becomes more advanced, the same thing will most likely happen to computers where they will become so ingrained into society that they will simply exist. They will be a part of our daily lives and we will most likely rely on them so much that we forget they are there. I think Lialina’s opinion might be a little bit flawed. I do not think we will ever stop being users, just not users of computers but rather users of programs. The term user might cease to exist when describing using computers but I think describing people as users when using a program like excel or photoshop will still remain. After all, once computers become truly invisible, then the programs will be at the forefront during operation. When that time comes, people will still be users, just not users of computers.</p>
          <p>Lialina’s ideal internet user would be the General Purpose User. These types of users can operate a computer through the use of programs to achieve things other than what was intended. Lialina gives the example that they can “write an article in their e-mail client…tweet without twitter, like without facebook…” (Lialina Invisible and Very Busy). Other names that they could be called are Universal Users or Turing Complete Users. This is a reference to the Universal Turing Machine which is Alan Turing’s ideal version of a computer that can complete any task with enough time and memory. Just like Turing’s computer, the Universal User can use the computer and achieve anything they want to do with it, without the need for a specific program or software. This means that the user would have to be creative when devising methods to complete a certain task. For example, there was an assignment where I had to create a digital drawing without the use of a drawing or art software. The way I completed that assignment was by using excel’s grid systems and fill tool to create artwork. This is not the intended way that excel was to be used but I made it work and accomplished what I needed to do.</p>
          <p>While interacting with the web there are many times when the experience may be broken due to technical errors, bugs, and just general seamlessness. A notable and common example would be whenever I needed to attach something when sending an email. It requires me to locate the file I want to attach to my computer which means that it does need user input to complete the task. While it might not be a big deal, there is still a disconnect where the smoothness is interrupted when I have to search for that file. For people who do not have organized file structures, it might take a while to find that file, maybe even a few minutes. This destroys the seamless process of sending an email. The smoothness of the whole process can be restored if it allows you to instantly attach the most recent files or send emails by directly right-clicking the file (this function might actually exist, but not intuitive to be well known). Same thing with receiving files, they might not open right away so you have to download them onto your computer to view them. Sometimes you do not designate a folder or area you want to download this file and it takes longer to find it.</p>

          <h3>Reading 5: the Poetry of Tools</h3>
          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>The Poetry of Tools by Mindy Seu</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools"> https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools</a></p>
          <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
          <p>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry? 
          <br>
          Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.
          </p>
          <p>I think defamiliarizing our tools in this context means that we should be conscious of what we are doing. Instead of using our “tools” in auto pilot because we have gotten so used to them, we should take a step back and stop using them in the way that we normally would. One way of looking at it would be to break away from the conventional use of these tools and instead establish usage based not on the creator’s intent. Seu also questions our lack of inquiry regarding said tools and their development. The rapid evolution of these tools prevents us from determining the cultural influence it may have on us. 
          <br>
          Seu’s usage of the word “poetry” in the context of tools means to be conscious of how these tools are used. We should also seek to gain a heightened understanding of these tools and find alternative or creative ways to utilize them. We should establish that tool’s palace within our lives and extrapolate what we can from them to enhance our day-to-day operations.</p>
          <p>One of the six categories defined by Seu is "Performing Data," which includes works that decontextualize data in order to highlight its inherent poetry. It is taking something informational and adding a visual aspect to it allowing the viewer to see and comprehend the data. Seu describes it as sequencing the data to demonstrate the structure of the data. It is taking something that otherwise may be difficult or outright impossible for the average person to understand and showcasing it in a way that they could comprehend. The example I found is a database of a digital humanities project that showcases a collection of artwork that depicts scenes and was influenced by the Divine Comedy created by Italian poet Dante Alighieri. This can be considered Performing Data as it takes the collection of artworks and arranges it in a way where a person can trace and visualize the connections. It provides the user the ability to easily search and look through all the artwork and the information pertaining to them. It also does it in a way that is visually pleasing and aesthetic.</p>

          <p>Hi guys, I'm Cathy! </p>
          <p>I'm going into my 4th year of Graphic Design.</p>
          <p>I chose to use <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> as my website tool to create this self portrait of me and my cat, Koi. I got my cat last year during the pandemic and honestly was one of the best decision I've ever made. I actually incorporated her into two of my other projects last term in Graphic Design 2, so she's been most of my inspiration so far. I've been trying to improve my coding knowledge and skills so what better way to do that than coding my own picture.</p>
          <p>Other than that I've been trying to get back into drawing and improving how to use procreate. I really like making DIYS and handcrafts like using polymer clay. I've been seeing artisan keycaps in my Instagram feed a lot and I wanna try making my own.</p>
