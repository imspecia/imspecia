	<p>Initially I started off by researching index websites and honestly could not find what I was looking for with just "index website" searches. Further into my research I mainly used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/" style="color: blue;"> Pinterest</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.awwwards.com/" style="color: blue;">awwwards</a> , and <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/trending" style="color: blue;">CodePen</a> to look for inspiration and animations that I could use. I ended up with my top three favourite website layouts / text animations from:</p>

	<p>[inspiration:<button class="btn"><a href="https://codepen.io/maskedcoder/pen/rNOMWQ" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" target="_blank">Split Menu</a></button>] <br>Initially I tried to recreate my top three websites by using their animations but it got very complicated or I was not sure how it would work. I was able to get some of the structures down but then there would be some things missing that would not get it to work. I tried to do this codepen menu but I scratched this idea because it did not have the aspects I loved from the other inspirations I had.</p>

	<h3>Experimenting:</h3>
	<p> <br> After struggling to recreate the index from <a href="https://themarcus.com/">https://themarcus.com/</a>, I wanted to use a similar box layout like <a href="https://www.gtheimagineers.com/fr.html">https://www.gtheimagineers.com/fr.html</a> I inspected the code and tried to recreate the look and feel but I could not get it to open up when you clicked on each section like the original did. After a long time experimenting, I found this [inspiration:<button class="btn"><a href="https://codepen.io/wesleyvanwyk1979/pen/DGWXzq" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" target="_blank">Accordion</a></button>] which was exactly what I was looking for. I realized that Javascript made a lot of the code more complicated and I was probably missing some code for the sections to function so I used this codepen as a template that I could work from. </p>

	<h3>LOADER:</h3>
	<p>I added a loader html that redirects you to the actual page after a few seconds of waiting. Using a simple animation and my colour palette, I was able to create a preloading screen for my website.</p>

	<h3>Reading Responses:</h3>
	<p>[Resource:<button class="btn"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_vertical_tabs" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" target="_blank">Vertical Tabs</a></button>] 
		<br>As I was creating my index page, the reading responses was a bit tricky to do. I decided to use the code from w3schools that creates vertical tabs. In order to keep the words hidden, I had to modify the code so that you can see the titles of the words when you hover over the tabs. I thought this method would be the easiest and best way to display all the reading responses in one place. </p>

	<h3>FINAL:</h3>
	<p>Here are the final colours. I decided that brown and black were too similar and there was not much contrast so I experimented with what background colour works well with the animation. This stategrey colour creates a more subtle look to <b>"ELEMENTS"</b> but it does not take away from it. I chose to keep the brown colour and have it as the 'dark mode' colour instead to make the colours pop more. </p>
