	<p>Initially I started off by researching index websites and honestly could not find what I was looking for with just "index website" searches. Further into my research I mainly used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/" style="color: blue;"> Pinterest</a> , <a target="_blank" href="https://www.awwwards.com/" style="color: blue;">awwwards</a> , and <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/trending" style="color: blue;">CodePen</a> to look for inspiration and animations that I could use. I ended up with my top three favourite website layouts / text animations from:</p>

	<p>I started off with coding a countdown timer. [inspiration:<button class="btn"><a href="https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/JJavZN" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" target="_blank">Countdown Timer</a></button>] <br>I started off using this code to get the idea of how to make a countdown timer but you have to manually change the month and day in the javascript. After playing around with code, I created a submission box where you would have to type out a day/ month/ year that you wanted to countdown from but it ended up with a lot of errors if it was not inputted correctly. The solution I found was using a calendar system so you can just pick any date in the future. I had to change minor issues like restricting the user from inputting a date that is before the present day. The background was initially a solid colour but then I opted to create a gradient background with the colour palette I used. I created a separate html and css file to create circles that spell out <b>“ELEMENTS”</b> with coloured bordered circles and solid coloured circles animating and spelling out each letter. I created this animation to add a visual to the website. When you first open this website it might take you a minute or so to realize what the circles spell out. As the circles move, I see myself following each moving circle as it loops endlessly, tracing each letter form.</p>

	<h3>Experimenting:</h3>
	<p>I looked into how to make a browser startup timer as well as a dark mode toggle. Down below you can see the two different variations with the inital background colours. The brown was the startup colour and the black was the dark mode colour. I created a colourful timer when it is 'light mode' and a simple white colour timer when it is in 'dark mode'. When you hover over the "Toggle Dark Mode" button, it will change colours. I decided to combine my countdown timer within the same page instead of creating a button to make an external page. Using containers, I lined up all my elements and created an illusion of having a second page at the bottom.</p>

	<h3>LOADER:</h3>
	<p>I added a loader html that redirects you to the actual page after a few seconds of waiting. Using a simple animation and my colour palette, I was able to create a preloading screen for my website.</p>

	<h3>FINAL:</h3>
	<p>Here are the final colours. I decided that brown and black were too similar and there was not much contrast so I experimented with what background colour works well with the animation. This stategrey colour creates a more subtle look to <b>"ELEMENTS"</b> but it does not take away from it. I chose to keep the brown colour and have it as the 'dark mode' colour instead to make the colours pop more. </p>
