Just like a book, a website can have multiple pages broken down into chapters. Perhaps it can be about your life, or just a collection of memories. Nothing too cramped or else the reader starts to get confused. Pick a theme and stick with it, then tell your story. If you run out of space, move on to the next book. Create a trilogy or even a whole series. Your story is never really over, life goes on and so does your story.</p1></div>
