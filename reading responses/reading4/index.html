Just like a book, a website can have multiple pages broken down into chapters or series. The navigation bar of a website indicates the topics each ‘chapter’ will talk about giving a brief insight to what is to come. Each chapter is an article, blog, or maybe a journal within the website.<br> Perhaps it can be about your life, or just a collection of memories. Nothing too cramped or else the reader starts to get confused. Pick a theme or concept and stick with it, then tell your story. Add some visuals to help the reader visualize what you are writing about. If you run out of space, move on to the next book. Create a trilogy or even a whole series. Your story is never really over, life goes on and so does your story. </p1> </div>
